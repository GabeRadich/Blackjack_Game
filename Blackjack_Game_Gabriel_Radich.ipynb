    "## This is a blackjack program:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is a blackjack program. In the beginning, you have $1000 to play the game. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    You and the dealer are given a deck of 52 shuffled cards. \n",
    "  \n",
    "    For each round, you need to bet some money, say x dollars. \n",
    "      - if you win, your total money = 1000 + x\n",
    "      - if you lose, your total money = 1000 - x\n",
    "      - if you tie with the program, your money has no change.\n",
    "    \n",
    "         \n",
    "    Game Rules:\n",
    "    (1) At first, you, the player, need to bet some money. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (2 ) Draw two card from the top of the deck for the player. Then convert card face number to points:\n",
    "        - Ace:    11 points\n",
    "        - Jack:   10 points\n",
    "        - Queen:  10 points\n",
    "        - King:   10 points\n",
    "        - Others: points = card face number\n",
    "        \n",
    "    (3) Do the same for dealer in the same manner. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (4) Display all physical cards and total points (yours and dealer)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (5) Compare your total points with dealer's:  \n",
    "        - if yours is higher than the dealer's, you win\n",
    "        - if equal, tie\n",
    "        - if yours is lower, you lose  \n",
    "        \n",
    "    (5) Now you finish one round.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The program will ask if the player plays again or not. Player can play until you want to quit or has no more money left or the deck is empty. Finally, the game is over. Print out the player's balance($ amount).\n",
